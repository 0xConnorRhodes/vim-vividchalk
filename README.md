fork of tpope/vim-vividchalk, customized for connorhodes 


I'm tweaking the colors to find a contrast high enough to work under fluorescent lights and low enough to be as usable as possible in a poorly lit environemnt. I also prefer a full black background to match my terminal. Special thanks to [tpope](https://github.com/tpope) for the original [theme](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vividchalk).
